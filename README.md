# Smart-Contracts-SMART CONTRACTS 

In this context about smart contracts, we will briefly look into the meaning of smart contracts, their uses, the steps in creating them, and their advantages and disadvantages before concluding what a smart contract entails.

INTRODUCTION 

In recent years, the term “smart” has become very popular: we live in “smart cities,” we use “smart fridges” or “smart ovens,” and of course, we could not function without our “smart phones.” The adjective “smart” means the object’s functionality has been vastly improved using software applications, i.e., part of the functionality has been automatized. The “smart phone" made the transfer of information easier than before, when one would need to travel miles away from his house to deliver information and okay a deal. It enables us to call people without touching the pad, and it will perform other valuable (yet repetitive) tasks for us. 

According to the law of England and Wales, a contract is a "legally binding agreement, which can be enforced in a court of law." For example, people come together to purchase a property and some documents to affirm that the property belong to the new owner will include a signed agreement. This, in turn, is called a contract. 

For our study today, merging the words "smart" and "contract", we now define it as a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This is similar to what Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist, is thought to have first used the term smart contract in an article in 1994 wrote(Szabo, 1994):

A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. 

Smart contracts run on a blockchain network and enable the transfer of digital assets without the need for intermediaries.The association between “smart contract” and “blockchain” was popularized by the development of Ethereum blockchain. Solidity, the programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, deploys the term “contract” instead of the “class” term to define small pieces of code that identify specific operations.

USES OF SMART CONTRACTS

The uses of smart contracts include:

Financial Services: Smart contracts can automate various financial transactions, such as issuing digital assets, peer-to-peer lending, and processing insurance claims.

Supply Chain Management: Smart contracts can be used to track and verify the movement of goods and services along a supply chain, from the point of origin to the final consumer.

Real Estate: Smart contracts can be used to automate the buying and selling of real estate, including the transfer of ownership and the release of funds upon completion of the transaction.

Voting Systems: Smart contracts can create secure and transparent voting systems where votes are recorded on a blockchain and cannot be altered. Such systems include the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), which the Nigerian electoral body used to conduct a credible electoral process.

Gaming and Gambling: Smart contracts can create provably fair gaming and gambling platforms that are transparent and secure.

Intellectual Property: Smart contracts can be used to manage intellectual property rights, such as the licensing and distributing copyrighted material.

Healthcare: Smart contracts can be used to manage patient data and medical records, ensuring they are secure and accessible to authorized parties.

  HOW TO CREATE A SMART CONTRACT 

Smart contracts are created using a programming language specifically designed for the blockchain, such as Solidity, which is used for the Ethereum blockchain. The following are the general steps to create a smart contract:

STEP 1: Choose a blockchain platform such as  Ethereum or EOS.

STEP 2: Decide on the contract details, such as the parties involved, the terms and conditions, and the actions to be taken in case of a breach.

STEP 3: Write the code for the smart contract using a blockchain programming language such as Solidity. You must use a development environment such as Remix or Truffle to write, compile, and test your smart contract.

STEP 4: Deploy the contract to the blockchain network. This is done by sending a transaction to the blockchain network with the smart contract code and other required information.

STEP 5: Interact with the contract by sending transactions to the contract address. The smart contract will automatically execute the terms of the agreement based on the programmed code.

ADVANTAGES OF SMART CONTRACTS.

Smart contracts offer several advantages over traditional contracts, which includes:

Efficiency: Smart contracts are automated and execute themselves without intermediaries. This reduces the time and cost of executing a contract and eliminates the possibility of errors or fraud caused by intermediaries.

Transparency: Smart contracts are stored on a public blockchain, which allows all parties to view the terms of the contract and the outcome of its execution. This creates a high level of transparency, which is especially useful in industries such as finance and supply chain management.

Security: Smart contracts are secured by the blockchain network, making them virtually impossible to alter or tamper with once executed. This creates a high level of security and trust among the parties involved.

Accuracy: Smart contracts are coded with precise instructions that are executed automatically, eliminating the possibility of human error or interpretation.

Accessibility: Smart contracts can be executed anywhere in the world, as long as an internet connection exists. This eliminates the need for physical meetings or paper-based contracts, making them more accessible and convenient.

DISADVANTAGES OF SMART CONTRACTS 

While smart contracts have many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to consider:

Immutability: A smart contract cannot be changed once deployed on the blockchain This means that if there are any errors or bugs in the code, they cannot be corrected, and the contract must be redeployed.

Limited functionality: Smart contracts are designed to execute specific instructions. They cannot perform complex computations or access external data sources, which limits their functionality.

Lack of flexibility: Smart contracts are generally inflexible and cannot be easily modified once deployed. This can be a problem if there are changes to the underlying blockchain technology or if there are changes to the business requirements.

Complexity: Smart contracts can be complex to develop and debug. They require specialized knowledge of blockchain technology and programming languages.

Cost: Smart contracts can be expensive to deploy on the blockchain, especially if they involve complex computations or require significant storage.

Legal uncertainty: There is still some legal uncertainty surrounding smart contracts, particularly around their enforceability and the role of intermediaries in disputes.

In conclusion, smart contracts are digital programs that automate the negotiation, execution, and enforcement of agreements between parties without the need for intermediaries. They offer several benefits over traditional contracts, including greater security, transparency, and efficiency. Smart contracts have many potential applications across various industries, and their popularity is expected to grow as blockchain technology becomes more widespread.
